# Frontend UI Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive updates made to the frontend UI to properly integrate with the backend API for department and project management.

## API Integration Points

### Department APIs Used
- `GET /departments` - Load all departments
- `POST /departments` - Create new department
- `PUT /departments/:id` - Update department
- `GET /admin/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics

### Project APIs Used
- `GET /projects` - Load all projects
- `POST /projects` - Create new project
- `PUT /projects/:id` - Update project
- `PATCH /projects/:id/status` - Update project status
- `GET /admin/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics

### User APIs Used
- `GET /admin/users?role=ADMIN` - Load potential managers

## Navigation Structure
The admin navigation now includes:
- `/admin` - Dashboard with overview statistics
- `/admin/users` - User management
- `/admin/departments` - Department management (updated)
- `/admin/projects` - Project management (updated)
- `/admin/assignments` - User assignment management

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Department Management**
   - [ ] Create a new department
   - [ ] Edit an existing department
   - [ ] Toggle department status
   - [ ] Assign a manager to a department
   - [ ] Create child departments

2. **Project Management**
   - [ ] Create a new project
   - [ ] Edit an existing project
   - [ ] Update project status
   - [ ] Filter projects by various criteria
   - [ ] Assign projects to departments

3. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Test with network disconnection
   - [ ] Test with invalid form data
   - [ ] Test API error responses

4. **UI/UX**
   - [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
   - [ ] Verify notification system works
   - [ ] Check loading states
   - [ ] Validate form interactions

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk department/project operations
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Add date range filters and search functionality
3. **Export/Import**: Add data export capabilities
