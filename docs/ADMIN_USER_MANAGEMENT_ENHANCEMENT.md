## Security & Authorization
- All endpoints require `ADMIN` role
- Uses existing UserAssignmentService authorization checks
- Validates user existence before operations
- Graceful error handling for batch operations

## Integration Points
- **UserAssignmentService**: Core assignment logic and authorization
- **Existing Admin Dashboard**: Enhanced with new user management capabilities
- **File Upload Authorization**: Works with existing file access control based on user assignments

## Benefits
1. **Complete User Management**: Admins can fully manage user-department-project relationships
2. **Batch Operations**: Efficient management of multiple users at once
3. **Role Flexibility**: Support for different roles within departments and projects
4. **Comprehensive Views**: Complete overview of user assignments
5. **Error Resilience**: Batch operations continue even if individual operations fail

## Future Enhancements
- Audit logging for all assignment changes
- Email notifications for role changes
- Advanced filtering for user assignment views
- Import/export functionality for bulk user management
- Real-time notifications for assignment updates
