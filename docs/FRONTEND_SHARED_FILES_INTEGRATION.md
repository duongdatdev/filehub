# Frontend Integration for Shared Files Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the frontend updates made to integrate with the new shared files API endpoints. The changes enable users to view and access files from their assigned departments and projects.

## New Features Added

### 1. New Shared Files Page (`SharedFilesPage.vue`)
- **Location**: `src/views/SharedFilesPage.vue`
- **Route**: `/files/shared`
- **Features**:
  - View all accessible files (own files + department files + project files + public files)
  - Filter by department or project
  - Advanced filtering by filename, file type, content type
  - Pagination and sorting
  - File preview and download
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. Updated API Service (`fileApi.ts`)
**New Methods Added**:
- `getSharedFiles()` - Get all files the user can access
- `getSharedFilesByDepartment()` - Get files from a specific department
- `getSharedFilesByProject()` - Get files from a specific project
- `getAdminSharedFiles()` - Admin-only endpoint for all shared files

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
- Added "Shared Files" navigation link in both desktop and mobile menus
- Created new `ShareIcon.vue` component
- Added quick access link in My Files page header

### 4. API Service Updates
**Department API (`departmentApi.ts`)**:
- Added `getUserDepartments()` method
- Added `DepartmentResponse` interface

**Project API (`projectApi.ts`)**:
- Added `getUserProjects()` method
- Added `ProjectResponse` interface

## Technical Implementation

### View Structure
The `SharedFilesPage.vue` includes:
1. **View Selector**: Toggle between "All Files", "By Department", and "By Project"
2. **Filters Section**: Search, file type, content type, and sorting options
3. **Files Grid**: Card-based layout with file information and actions
4. **Pagination**: For large file sets

### Key Features
- **Access Control**: Files show ownership indicators and respect permissions
- **Visual Indicators**: Visibility badges (PUBLIC, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, PRIVATE)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Performance**: Pagination and lazy loading
- **User Experience**: Clear navigation and intuitive filters

### File Actions
- **Download**: Available for all accessible files
- **View**: File preview/details
- **Ownership Indicators**: Shows "Your File" for user's own files

## API Integration
The frontend now uses these new endpoints:
- `GET /api/files/shared` - All accessible files
- `GET /api/files/shared/department/{id}` - Department-specific files
- `GET /api/files/shared/project/{id}` - Project-specific files
- `GET /api/admin/files/shared` - Admin access to all files

## Navigation Updates
1. **Desktop Navigation**: Added "Shared Files" link with share icon
2. **Mobile Navigation**: Added mobile-friendly shared files link
3. **My Files Page**: Added quick access button to shared files

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Clear Access Indicators**: Users can see which files are theirs vs shared
2. **Department/Project Context**: Files are organized by their source
3. **Search & Filter**: Easy to find specific files
4. **Responsive Design**: Works well on all devices
5. **Consistent Design**: Matches existing UI patterns

## Security Considerations
- All file access respects backend authorization
- Users only see files they have permission to access
- File operations (download, view) are validated by the backend
- No sensitive information exposed in the frontend

## Testing
To test the new features:
1. Start the backend server: `./gradlew bootRun` (from filehub-back)
2. Start the frontend server: `npm run dev` (from filehub-front)
3. Navigate to `/files/shared` to see the new shared files page
4. Test different views: All Files, By Department, By Project
5. Test filtering and pagination
6. Test file download and view actions

## Issues Fixed

### Import/Export Issues
- **Fixed**: Corrected import statements in `SharedFilesPage.vue` to use default imports for API services
- **Fixed**: `departmentApi`, `projectApi`, and `fileTypeApi` are exported as default, not named exports
- **Fixed**: Proper TypeScript interface imports for better type safety

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Added**: Helper method `buildFilterParams()` in `fileApi.ts` to reduce code duplication
- **Refactored**: All filter parameter building now uses the centralized helper method
- **Improved**: Type safety with proper interface definitions

## Development Server Status
- Frontend running on: http://localhost:5173/
- Backend running on: http://localhost:8080/ (via gradle task)

The frontend is now fully integrated with the shared files API and ready for testing and further development.
